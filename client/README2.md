This is a pretty cool tutorial on Material UI + React Router, using a Responsive Drawer.
In App.js file I have a Layout component that renders an appbar and a responsive drawer. This program has some really cool routing in it. Theres routing in App.js as well as in Writers/index.js.

Key takeways:

1. There's a different way to style Material-ui in a functional component and class component.
2. When not to use "exact" attribute. See App.js.
   Also, see "/writers" route on App.js. The <Writers> component is pretty interesting. It renders a <ul> and 2 <Route> components.

How to run this program: npm start
This program is front end only!!
